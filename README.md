## ChatBot with GUI and BART Summarizer

This project is a ChatBot with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that uses the BART (Bidirectional and AutoRegressive Transformer) model for summarizing text. The ChatBot can respond to user input in natural language and provide a summary of any text entered by the user.

> note! you need to provide API Key from huggingface in order to use BART

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library
- nltk library
- numpy library
- tensorflow library

## Installation

3. Open the `main.py` file and run it using Python.

## Usage

1. Type a message in the text box and press Send button to send it to the ChatBot.
2. The ChatBot will respond with a message based on its NLP algorithms.
3. Start your messge with '&' to summerize your large paragraph

## Features

The ChatBot with GUI and BART Summarizer has the following features:

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy user interaction
